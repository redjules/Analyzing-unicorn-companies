# Analyzing unicorn companies

In this project, we will figure out how many companies reached a valuation of over 1 billion dollars across different industries in a given time period.

Specifically, we'll need to identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new high-growth companies created in that period, find the number of unicorns that emerged within these industries by year, the year when each of those companies became a unicorn, and their average valuation in billions of dollars. 

For this project, we will use a PostgreSQL database containing several tables.
